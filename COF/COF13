    Define the cloud strategy and governance policies to ensure alignment with the organization's goals and objectives.
    Develop the cloud roadmap and prioritize initiatives based on business needs and technical feasibility.
    Establish the cloud governance board to oversee the cloud adoption and monitor compliance.

    Cloud Architecture:

    Design the cloud architecture that meets the business requirements and is scalable, reliable, and secure.
    Develop and maintain the cloud reference architecture and design patterns.
    Define the cloud migration strategy and plan.

    Cloud Operations:

    Manage the day-to-day cloud operations, including monitoring, alerting, backup and recovery, security, and compliance.
    Optimize the cloud resources and costs by using automation, scaling, and right-sizing techniques.
    Ensure high availability and disaster recovery for critical applications and services.

    Cloud Development:

    Develop and deploy cloud applications and services using Azure DevOps.
    Implement DevOps practices and tools, including continuous integration and deployment, automated testing, and infrastructure as code.
    Monitor and optimize the application performance and availability.

    Cloud Data and Analytics:

    Develop and manage the cloud data and analytics platform using Azure Cloud Toolkit and Power BI.
